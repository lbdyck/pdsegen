% NOTES
`
` 1.  Browse works as you would expect it to on both normal members
`     and member generations.
`
` 2.  Using Edit or View you can use all normal edit commands,
`     including edit macros. However commands that reference other
`     members can only reference the base, or generation 0, member.
`
` 3.  Multiple members may be selected for Browse or View but Edit
`     will only work if the member IS NOT saved or updated.  If a
`     member is saved or updated then all rows for that member are
`     deleted and re-added to include the updated generation info.
`
` 4.  It shouldn't have to be stated but generations are only
`     supported for PDSE Version 2 datasets where generations have
`     been enabled when the dataset was allocated.
`
` 5.  Edit will be converted to View for non-0 generation members.
`
` 6.  The Compare command only accepts relative generation numbers.
`
` 7.  The Compare line option will compare the base generation (gen 0)
`     to the selected non-0 generation.
`
` 8.  It is possible to allow Edit to edit a generation BUT when that
`     happens only the generation is updated and the base member is
`     NOT updated. Thus the generation with the update could be lost
`     and/or hidden since it is not possible to access a generation
`     using dynamic allocation or JCL.
`
`     This application has been configured to prevent editing non-0
`     generations.
`
` 11. The e-mail option utilizes XMITIP using the XMITIPFE (front end)
`     exec. This option is only available if the mail variable is
`     customized to 1.
`
` 12. Aliases are NOT supported by this application at this time and they
`     are not displayed in the member list.
`
` 13. If using FIND you can improve the performance by reducing the number
`     of members to search by using Filter before Find.
`
` 14. Prune operates on only the members in the display list so
`     using Filter before Prune is a good way to limit the members
`     that Prune will clean up.
`
` 15. Before using Prune a Backup is recommended (CYA).
`
` 16. PDSEGEN supports extended statistics. If a member has more than 64K
`     (65535) records then the only way to display the actual record count
`     is to turn on extended statistics using the ISPF Edit command STATS
`     EXT.
`
` 17. The ISPF Edit COMPARE command has been changed to use the PDSEGCPR
`     edit macro. This allows the ability to still do all the normal
`     compares AND adds the ability to, while in Edit or View, to compare
`     to other member generations.
`
` 18. If you see a member with a -1 generation and there is no 0 generation
`     that indicates that the member was deleted outside of PDSEGEN. The
`     normal ISPF member delete will delete the base member but leave the
`     generations and the base member will become the -1 generation.  PDSE
`     pending delete processing should clean this up at some point.
`
` 19. The Member list display defaults to a 2 digit year display. Using the
`     Left or Right keys (F10 or F11) will shift to use the 4 digit year
`     display by removing the Initial size field from the table. This view
`     is remembered across sessions.
`
` 20. When Hide is active, Delete, Prune, and Rename are not available.
`
` 21. PDSEGEN supports up to approximately 42000 members, or members and
`     generations. Any member, or generation, beyond that will not be
`     processed, even if filtering is used.
`
` 22. The more members, or members and generations, in a PDS/PDSE the more
`     processing is required to read the information and build the ISPF
`     table. Just be aware if the PDS/PDSE has a large number of members,
`     or members and generations.
`
` 23. Dummy members are those members that are displayed using the HIGEN
`     command. These members are actually small pseudo-members in the PDSE
`     directory that contain the highest absolute generation number used by
`     the member when the member had generations. If a member has at least
`     one generation then there will be no dummy member. If a member has
`     never had any generations there will be no dummy member.  if all a
`     members generations are deleted then a dummy member will be created.
`     If a member and all of its generations are deleted then a dummy
`     member is created. This member is used to restart the absolute
`     generation counter when generations are once again created for that
`     member name.
`
` 24. The Orphan command will limit the display to only the orphan, or
`     dummy elements.
